# Transaction Data Analysis

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze transactional data to gain insights into import/export activities, product categories, shipping methods, supplier relationships, and payment terms. By visualizing key patterns and distributions, the project aims to help decision-makers understand transaction trends, identify preferred suppliers and shipping methods, and optimize operational processes related to trade and procurement.

## Problem Statement
The company faces challenges in effectively managing and understanding its transactional data across multiple dimensions such as import/export, shipping methods, and supplier performance. There is a need for a clear analysis of how transactions are distributed across different categories and the impact of various factors, such as payment terms and shipping methods, on the overall efficiency of operations. This project seeks to provide actionable insights through data visualization, enabling better decision-making and process optimization in trade and procurement activities.

## Dataset Features
The dataset consists of transactional records that include the following features:
1. **Import/Export Indicator**: Whether a transaction was an import or export.
2. **Product Categories**: Categorizes transactions based on the type of product.
3. **Shipping Method**: Method used to ship the product (e.g., air, sea, ground).
4. **Supplier**: Information about the suppliers involved in the transactions.
5. **Payment Terms**: Agreed terms between the buyer and supplier (e.g., net 30 days, prepaid).
6. **Number of Transactions**: Records how many transactions occurred for different products, suppliers, and categories.

## Analysis Techniques
- **Bar Plots**: To visualize the count of transactions by different categories (product, supplier, etc.).
- **Pie Charts**: To show the distribution of transactions by import/export status, shipping methods, and payment terms.

## Insights
### 1. Import vs. Export Distribution
A pie chart illustrates the distribution of import and export transactions, helping to identify whether the company is more involved in importing or exporting goods.

### 2. Product Category Distribution
A bar plot shows the number of transactions across different product categories, aiding in resource allocation and inventory management.

### 3. Shipping Method Preferences
By visualizing the distribution of shipping methods (e.g., air, sea, ground), the company can identify the most commonly used shipping options and assess their cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

### 4. Supplier Transaction Volume
A bar chart highlights the number of transactions by supplier, which helps evaluate supplier performance and dependency.

### 5. Payment Terms Distribution
A pie chart displays the breakdown of payment terms (e.g., net 30, prepaid), providing insights into the company’s financial agreements with suppliers and their impact on cash flow.

## Observations and Findings
1. **Balanced Import/Export Activity**: A relatively balanced number of import and export transactions, indicating the company's diversified market approach.
2. **Dominant Product Categories**: Certain product categories have significantly higher transaction volumes, suggesting a need for enhanced inventory management and supply chain optimization.
3. **Preference for Certain Shipping Methods**: The company shows a preference for one or two shipping methods, which may impact costs and efficiency.
4. **Supplier Dependence**: A few suppliers handle the majority of transactions, highlighting potential risks in supply chain reliability.
5. **Payment Terms Insight**: The majority of transactions fall under specific payment terms, with a focus on managing cash flow and supplier relationships.

## Key Findings
- The company’s operations are well-diversified between import and export activities.
- A few product categories and suppliers dominate transaction volumes, indicating areas for potential optimization in procurement and inventory.
- The company's shipping method choices reflect logistical preferences that might need review for cost-effectiveness.
- Supplier reliance suggests a need for better risk management in the supply chain.
- The financial health of supplier relationships is largely driven by current payment terms, with room for improvement in cash flow management.

## Managerial Insights
1. **Balanced Market Strategy**: Diversification between import and export activities minimizes risks related to global economic fluctuations.
2. **Product Focus and Demand**: Managers should assess whether underperforming product categories can be scaled or phased out.
3. **Shipping Method Efficiency**: Alternative shipping methods could reduce costs or expedite deliveries.
4. **Supplier Risk Management**: Diversifying suppliers can help mitigate risks related to supply chain disruptions.
5. **Payment Terms Optimization**: Renegotiating payment terms with suppliers could improve the company’s cash flow.

## Recommendations
1. **Market Segmentation and Profitability Review**: Analyze the profitability of import and export transactions to identify the most lucrative markets.
2. **Product Portfolio Management**: Focus on optimizing top-performing product categories and assess the scalability of underperforming lines.
3. **Shipping Method Review**: Reevaluate current shipping methods for cost-efficiency and delivery speed, and renegotiate contracts where applicable.
4. **Supplier Diversification Strategy**: Reduce over-reliance on key suppliers by diversifying and regularly reviewing supplier performance.
5. **Renegotiate Payment Terms**: Review and renegotiate payment terms with suppliers to improve cash flow and foster better supplier relationships.

## Conclusion
By acting on the insights provided, the company can enhance operational efficiency, mitigate supply chain risks, and improve cash flow management. This will lead to better overall performance and profitability.
